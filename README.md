![Project Banner](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1576091160550-2173dba999ef?auto=format&fit=crop&w=1920&q=80)

A modern, full-stack web application designed to streamline patient-doctor interactions. This platform features a robust appointment booking system with doctors available near you and as a second application feature there is an innovative AI-powered pre-consultation tool that transcribes patient conversations and generates preliminary clinical documentation, such as SOAP notes and differential diagnoses which patients can refer just to get an overview, an idea of what can be the possible problem before meeting real doctors whose appointment they have booked.

## ‚ú® Key Features

This platform is divided into two main user roles, each with a dedicated portal, alongside a powerful AI-driven consultation module.

### ü§ñ AI-Powered Clinical Consultation
- **Voice-to-Text Transcription**: Real-time audio recording and transcription of the patient's description of their condition using the Deepgram API.
- **Dynamic Conversational AI**: An AI assistant (Dr. Steve) asks clarifying follow-up questions to gather more detailed information, powered by the Groq API.
- **Automated SOAP Note Generation**: Upon finalizing the conversation, a structured SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) note is automatically generated.
- **Differential Diagnosis Suggestions**: The system provides a list of potential differential diagnoses with rationales to assist the clinician.

### üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Doctor Portal
- **Secure Authentication**: Secure registration and JWT-based login for doctors.
- **Availability Management**: Doctors can set their location (city, state) and manage their weekly schedule with specific time slots.
- **Appointment Dashboard**: View upcoming and past appointments, including patient details.
- **Performance Optimized**: Doctor search results are cached using Redis to ensure fast query responses.

### ü§ï Patient Portal
- **Secure Authentication**: Secure registration and JWT-based login for patients.
- **Advanced Doctor Search**: Find doctors by name, speciality, city, or state.
- **Effortless Booking**: View a doctor's available slots and book an appointment in just a few clicks.
- **Appointment Management**: View upcoming and past appointments and cancel upcoming ones if needed.
- **Email Notifications**: Receive automatic email confirmations for booked and cancelled appointments.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- `npm` or `yarn`
- A running instance of MongoDB
- A running instance of Redis
- API keys from [Groq](https://console.groq.com/keys) and [Deepgram](https://console.deepgram.com/signup).

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/swap-githubb-patient-booking-and-ai-consulting-application.git
    cd swap-githubb-patient-booking-and-ai-consulting-application

      # JWT Secret
      JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key

      # External APIs
      DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_deepgram_api_key
      GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key

      # Nodemailer (e.g., using a service like Brevo/SendGrid or a Gmail account)
      SMTP_HOST=your_smtp_host
      SMTP_PORT=587
      SMTP_SECURE=false # (true for port 465, false for other ports)
